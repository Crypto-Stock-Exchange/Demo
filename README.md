# Crypto Stock Exchange
Crypto Stock Exchange is a demo project that bridges the traditional stock market with the decentralized crypto ecosystem. We integrated key DeFi protocols—AAVE and Uniswap V3—to bring prediction-based stock exposure into the crypto space.

## 🔗 Live demo (no real money required): <a>https://crypto-stock-exchange.com</a>

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
Vue.js – Frontend

Flask – Backend API

C++ – For high-performance data processing and parallel computations

PostgreSQL – Database

We used C++ in parts of the system that required handling large amounts of data efficiently and taking advantage of parallelism.

## 💡 Note: This is a demo project. Only test coins are used. No real financial risk is involved.
## 💵 The server is currently limited to a $5/month plan, so performance may degrade slightly with high user traffic.

## 📈 How It Works
You predict a price range for a given stock.

You lock your funds for a specific time period.

If the stock price remains within your selected range, you earn rewards.

If the price moves outside your range, you gradually lose a portion of your stake depending on how long it stays out of bounds. This process is called liquidation.

Rewards are redistributed from less accurate predictions to more accurate ones.

Reward Calculation Factors:
Accuracy: Narrower ranges earn more.

Duration: Longer commitments offer greater potential returns.

Risk: Higher stakes give a bigger share of the reward pool.

Early withdrawal is possible but comes with a significant fee, which is redistributed to users with accurate predictions who stayed committed.
