# Crypto Stock Exchange

---

This project would help integrate stocks into the crypto world.
We combined 2 main technologies, the AAVE and V3 protocols.

---

We use different technologies for the project such as Vue, C++, Flask, PostgreSQL (The C++ part was needed because this language is useful for handling a lot of data and is very good for parallel programming)

---

You can share your thoughts on any problems with the application in the issues panel.

This site is just a demo, it does not require real money, only test coins and can be viewed here: <a>https://crypto-stock-exchange.com/</a>
